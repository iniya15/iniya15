# Heyo, I'm Iniya! 👽

💫 **About Me**  
I'm a CS engineering student who enjoys building practical projects and understanding how things work end to end. I like turning ideas into clean, functional systems and learning by actually building, not just reading docs forever.

I’m especially interested in web development, problem solving, and exploring ML-based applications. I enjoy working both independently and in teams, and I’m always curious about how tech can be used meaningfully in real life.
